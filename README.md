# Algorithms and Data Structures II (AEDS II)

This repository contains implementations, exercises, and study materials developed during the Algorithms and Data Structures II course.

The course begins with a strong foundation in Algorithm Analysis, covering execution time measurement, operation counting, floor and ceiling functions, summations, cost functions, and asymptotic behavior. It includes a detailed study of Big-O, Big-Ω, and Big-Θ notations, growth rate classes, and the distinction between polynomial and exponential algorithms.

The second part of the course focuses on sorting algorithms, including Selection Sort, Heapsort, and Quicksort, analyzing their performance and complexity.

## We then explore fundamental data structures, such as:

- Stacks

- Queues

- Linear lists

- Singly linked lists

- Doubly linked lists

## Advanced data structures are also covered, including:

- Binary Search Trees (search, insertion, removal, and traversals)

- AVL Trees

- Hash Tables (concepts, hash functions, insertion, search, collision handling, and removal)
